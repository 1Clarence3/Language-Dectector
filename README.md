# Language-Dectector
Goal: This project aims to detect the language of a given text. 
This project is limited to only detecting 15 specified languages
in the code.

Notes: This project uses mainly for loops and reading files into 
strings in order to calculate frequencies for each individual letter 
as well as frequency differences between each language. I also used
the imported turtle and tkinter modules for graphics. For text to
speech, I used the imported gTTS module. 

IMPORTANT!: Please enter in at least 15 lines of text otherwise 
the program might detect a language other than the language the 
text was written in. Additionally, please click "OK" after pasting in text 
in order for the text to be saved into a text file to be read when
you click "Detect language".

The Pause button for "Text to Speech" currently won't pause, but 
instead of will just start from the beginning of the text and start
speaking.
